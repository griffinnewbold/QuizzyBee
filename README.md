## Lasting Technical Debt
We worked very hard to ensure that there are no errors (there aren't as the app builds just fine) and we also worked hard to ensure XCode didn't generate any warnings, we managed to remove all but 1 warning which is simply warning of a deprecated feature, when we followed the suggestions of XCode to remove the warning, we received logic errors with regard to our navigation so we felt it was best to leave this single warning in so we may avoid these errors for now. If we had more time to continue development we would certainly ensure this warning would be fixed and removed while maintaining proper functionality of the app.
